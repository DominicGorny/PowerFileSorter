##Power Sorter
#### Power sorter is under development by Dominic Gorny and is currently a work in progress.

## The end goal
Power sorter is to be an application that can sort files and folders based on a pre defined set of rules provided by the user. 
For example a user might be able to sort the photos they have taken first into categories by date and then by file type.

## current implementation
The current implementation of power sorter allows for thew viewing of files as folder and for some movement within these on the interface, however complete operations and a full fidelity UI have not yet been implemented.
